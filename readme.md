# 👋 Hey there

I’m Ross a **part-time full stack developer** who enjoys building cool stuff for fun — especially around **web development** and **FiveM**.
I love scripting, solving problems, and creating systems that actually *work* — whether that’s a new in-game feature or a full **custom CRM** that ties everything together.

---

## 💻 What I Do

🧠 I like turning ideas into working systems — mostly small projects that grow into something bigger.  
🎮 I spend a lot of time scripting on **FiveM**, working with **Lua** and **QBOX/FiveM APIs** to create unique RP features.  
🧩 On the web side, I build **custom CRM systems**, dashboards, and tools that make things more organized and easier to manage.

## ❤️ What Drives Me

I build because I **enjoy it** — scripting on FiveM, experimenting with new frameworks, and seeing something I made actually come to life.  
For me, development isn’t a job — it’s something that keeps me curious, creative, and always learning.
